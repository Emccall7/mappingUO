1 Franklin Blvd Lifeline. The route to work in the morning from Moon Mountain where our house is located, and the route home after work. Generally it includes a stop at Market of Choice, where we buy nearly all our groceries. They no longer sell Barefoot wine (damn) so I am reduced to buying the Velvet Devil merlot. Sometimes includes a stop at Hirons, where, if you want, you could ask one of the employees where you could find underpants for squirrels and that employee would immediately answer with a straight face, ""That would be on aisle 9, on the left near the end.

2 Parking lot across the street from Dad's Gate bus stop. Where we pay over $500 a year to have a parking spot, unless of course, someone is already parked in our reserved spot. In which case we have to call campus police and tell them someone is parked in the sport we paid a shitload of money to reserve, to which campus police always reply, ""We're sorry, there's nothing we can do about it."" Which means we'll have to find a parking spot somewhere with a parking meter that will cost about $8 and we'll be late to our morning class.

3 Allen Hall Home away from home. I spend more hours in Allen Hall than I do in my house. It used to be such an incredible meeting place for highly intelligent people with thought-provoking ideas. Then Covid hit, and we were literally locked out of Allen for a year. You had to have an escort to go into your office for any reason. And that was followed by another year of remote teaching, which taught students they did not have to do anything they didn't want to do because they university was only interested in their tuition dollars, not actually teaching. And faculty realized they could work from home, which was a lot more relaxing than having to come to work in Allen. Now, instead of an incubation site for great ideas, Allen Hall is an empty shell, often deserted most of the time. What a shame.

4 Agate Hall Our temporary home away from home while Allen Hall was undergoing major renovation. Kind of a fun place to be. Formerly an elementary school, the north door has a sign above it that says Boys, and the south has a sign that says Girls. The restrooms have toilets designed for 7-year-olds so they are impossible to use. I've been around the world a couple of times, and Agate is the only place I've ever seen urinals that face each other so you can decide whether your colleague has an interesting penis or not.

5 Matthew Knight Arena Because I not only teach sports photography, but also shoot sports events for publication, I spend hours and hours and hours in Matthew Knight Arena. Have been thrown out a couple of times for violating the media protocols, which is always interesting when a crackhead security guard hired for minimum wage tosses you. And also where the graduation ceremony happens every year, which, in its own way, is a social event like no other.

6 Hayward Field New Hayward Field or Old Hayward Field? Oh my god!!! You're not going to tear down the very wooden bleachers where my grandparents watched Pre run his historic runs??? What nonsense. It used to be open 24 hours a day so it was a great place to jog and just work out. After the renovation, you have to have a permission slip from the governor to enter the facility and then have a body orifice examination.

7 Erb Memorial Union I almost never go into the Erb. Except to have tech folks explain to me why my password no longer allows me to open Canvas.

8 Pioneer Cemetery One of the coolest places ever. An actual cemetery with graves going all the way back to the mid-1800s. Most people think it is part of the university but it is not. It is the only cemetery I have ever seen used as a park. People walk their dogs through it, people jog through it, students (including my sons) meet there to drink beer and smoke pot, all the while at times standing just feet above dead people. What a cool place.

9 Johnson Hall Never have a need to go in. But I'm old enough that I can't see the front steps of Johnson Hall without immediately thinking of the movie Animal House and John Belushi leading the horse up the steps to accidentally kill it in the president's office. The man in the movie who used a chainsaw to cut the horse corpse up to remove it was the best friend of the real estate agent who sold me my house.

10 Gerlinger Also a landmark from the Animal House movie. It was where Otter goes to pick up his date Fawn Hall, only to find out she was killed in a kiln explosion.

11 Knight Library For those who bitch about Phil Knight donating so much money for the football team, they never seem to acknowledge Knight Library is named Knight Library for a reason.
